# After Effects Expressions Cheatsheet

This repository collects a curated set of everyday After Effects expressions, grouped by common tasks such as motion, timing, utility helpers, and text automation. Each snippet in `common-expressions.jsx` includes inline comments describing what it does, the property to apply it to, and any required expression controls.

## Getting Started

1. Open the `common-expressions.jsx` file in a text editor.
2. Copy the expression you want to use.
3. In After Effects, Alt/Option-click the stopwatch for the target property and paste the expression.
4. Add any required Expression Controls (Slider, Checkbox, etc.) and rename them to match the comments.

## Categories Covered

- **Core motion**: wiggle variations, spring follow, orbit, and 3D look-at helpers.
- **Timing and looping**: smooth, loop variants, bounce, time offsets, and time-remap easing.
- **Controls and randomness**: slider/checkbox utilities, flicker, fades, marker-driven switches, and layer staggering.
- **Text and shape helpers**: auto-sizing backgrounds, typewriter reveals, and countdown timers.

Feel free to duplicate the snippets into separate files if you prefer organizing expressions by category. Contributions that add well-tested, broadly useful expressions are welcome.
